> The Editor is basically the heart of DIARIUM. It should equip you with all the fancy tools you need for creating personalized diary entries.  

This is the reason I really put a lot of time and effort into finding the best possible editor for diarium. I didn't knew at that time, that this was going to be a very challenging task  
  
So I just started without further ado and quickly found a quite interesting editor: [Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/).  
This one really looked modern and intuitive and also produced clean JSON output.  
So, again without any further planning or thinking, I immediately integrated Editor.js into DIARIUM and... was suddenly pretty unhappy.  
At the time the editor lacked some basic MVP features like a readonly mode. The table support was OKish at best and many other things just didn't make so much sense for my use case.

Once rehabilitated from that mistake, I decided to set up a list of pros and cons of various editors and editor frameworks.  
[The list can be found as an GitHub issue here.](https://github.com/mriot/diarium/issues/31)
